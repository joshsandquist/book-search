# Book Search Engine

  ## Description
  This projects is a code refactor of a book search engine that was working with RESTFul API and converting it to GraphQL and Apollo Server. It required an overhaul of both the client and server sides of the application. While the mongoose models remained the same, the server side needed typeDefs and Resolvers defined, based off of the already existing RESTful methods. The project used Query and Mutation methods, which then had to be implemented into the front end React components. There was also some refactoring needed to properly authenticate users and manage their logged in state.

  ## Installation
  No installation required - Runs on deployed heroku URL.

  ## Usage
  This project used a variety of technologies, some of which were implemented in the starter code, but some had to be integrated to make the application compatible with GraphQL and Apollo Server. The full application has the same functionallity as the previous RESTful API version

  ## Technologies Used

  * React
  * ExpressJS
  * MongoDB
  * NodeJS
  * JWT
  * Apollo
  * GraphQL
  * Mongoose
  * Heroku

  ## Challenges
  This project taught me quite a bit in terms of debugging. After scrapping a first attempt at this refactor, I had to dive deeper into exactly what needed changing and what needed to stay. I felt confident and comfortable refactoring the RESTful controllers into GraphQL typeDefs and Resolvers, but struggled with the client side. I decided that adding in some console error messaging was the step I needed to take to find out where the issues lie. Once I had an idea on where my issues were coming from, completing the code was much simpler. I learned that refactoring an already built complex application can have just as many hurdles as building one from scratch! Looking back at previous module activities really helped me get focused on what information was important, and what didn't need to be touched.
